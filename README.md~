Edhitha-Test
============

Its For Edhitha 2015




The Files need OPENCV , NUMPY .
It detects a shape over a region and masks it.

Maintain Workflow - connect each module and divide the work.( think about this and do it properly) 

backprojection - removes noise 
blobextract - extracts blob
coutours - finds target

remaining tasks - detect color, detect aplhanumeric character, detect gps coordinates, get workflow. 
(deadline - 15th Feb) 

test-images - for all the images
procima - for the blobs(all)

Added dashboard file = Every task in one window :D - Mostly for manual layer. 

Have to work on auto layer UI. 

So this is the workflow - Three folders. 
1. From Camera : Where all the pictures directly from the uav are stored. 
2. All_Blobs : Where all the blobs including useless blobs are stored. 
3. Useful_Blobs : Where only the useful Blobs are stored. 

Auto Layer - Working on it. 
So the semi-auto Layer is 70 % done. (Just file sequencing for blob extraction/ folders left) 
Fully Manual Layer is 50 % Done. (Going to prev image not working) - [Look at slideshow0.py]

booooooooooooooooooooo
